# Google maps service

To display the map, be sure to set your own API key inside the debug/release resources file `google_maps_api.xml` and active the API inside your google developer console.

Verify that your application has access to the API by checking that the API key, SHA-1 and package name enter inside your developer console is identical to your application.
